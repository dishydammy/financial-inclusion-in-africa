# Overview
This project aims to predict whether an individual is likely to have a bank account based on demographic, social, and economic factors. The goal is to support financial inclusion by identifying underserved populations and improving access to financial services.

This project was created as part of a Zindi competition on predicting bank account ownership, leveraging historical data to develop a predictive model.

# Key Features
Predicting bank account ownership using features like age, income, education, and employment status.
Data exploration and modeling using machine learning techniques to assess financial inclusion.
Project Structure

# Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the data to uncover patterns and insights.
Modeling: Built and evaluated various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict whether an individual has a bank account.

# Evaluation
The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy

# Technologies Used
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and experimentation
